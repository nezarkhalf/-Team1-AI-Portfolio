This folder contains the code and related files for our Research Assistant Agent project.

## Project Overview
This project implements an AI powered research assistant that:
- Finds information from multiple sources
- Summarizes text automatically
- Evaluates source credibility
- Handles user feedback and adapts over time
- Uses a fallback mechanism when search tools fail

The system uses external tools, a memory system, summarization model, and safety controls to generate structured research reports.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Hugging Face Transformers
- DuckDuckGo Search API
- Wikipedia API
- Gradio UI
- 
- ## Features
✔️ Web search  
✔️ Summarization  
✔️ Credibility evaluation  
✔️ Feedback learning  
✔️ Safety filters  
✔️ Fallback to Wikipedia  
✔️ Web-based interface
